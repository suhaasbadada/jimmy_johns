# Indiana Toxicity Watch: Mapping Health & Environmental Risks

[View the Tool!](https://jimmy-johns.onrender.com/)

## Project Overview

The Indiana Toxicity Watch platform is designed to empower citizens, policymakers, and researchers by providing a comprehensive, accessible, and interactive tool to monitor toxic chemicals, their geolocation, and the associated health risks in Indiana. This project integrates multiple data sources, offering visualizations, health risk analysis, and a web-based search tool to track environmental risks and enable informed decisions.

## Objective

The platform aggregates publicly available data on toxic chemicals, correlates them with health outcomes, and provides users with the ability to search, visualize, and analyze environmental risks in Indiana. The tool is intended to help users understand the potential health impacts of toxic exposure and make decisions based on location-based data.

## Key Features

- **Data Aggregation & Cleansing**: Integrated data from various public sources, cleaned and standardized for ease of use.
- **Visualization Dashboard**: An interactive map that allows users to filter by chemical, health outcomes, and location proximity to important areas like schools, hospitals, and residential zones.
- **Health Risk Analysis**: Comprehensive models have been built that examine the correlation between toxic chemical exposure and health outcomes such as cancer, respiratory diseases, and other conditions. Leveraging machine learning, specifically Random Forest Regressors, the analysis uncovers critical insights into the impact of various chemicals on human health, identifies key contributing factors, and aids in understanding broader environmental health patterns.
- **Web-Based Search Tool**: Users can search by zip code, address, or area of interest to instantly view contamination risks and health data.
- **Data Insights and Reporting**: Visualize trends over time, with downloadable reports to assist advocacy for environmental policy changes.

## Repo Structure
- cdccTool/ - complete flask code for the web based tool which interlinks between dashboards and visual graphs and trend charts.
- derivedData/ - filtered datasets relevant to Indiana post analysis of multiple data sources and files.

### Spills Data
This dataset contains details of chemical spills across various counties in Indiana.
Dataset Link: https://www.in.gov/idem/cleanups/investigation-and-cleanup-programs/emergency-response/

### Quality of Life and Premature Death Statistics
This dataset provides comprehensive insights into the quality of life and premature death rates for each county. Quality of life is represented through state rankings, highlighting where each county stands. Premature death statistics are detailed by actual death counts and years of potential life lost (YPLL), offering a nuanced understanding of mortality impacts.
